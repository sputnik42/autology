# Update

Updates the autology directory by updating the log files or the out generation templates that are defined.

## Configuration

This command is configured through command line arguments.

- `-f` or `--files`

  > Indicate that the command will be responsible for modifying the log files.  It will walk through them and provide
  > the contents to each of the updaters.  These updaters will look at the metadata information in the front matter to
  > determine if the contents of the front matter need to be updated to match a new scheme.  Running this command 
  > multiple times shouldn't modify the data on any attempt after the first.

- `-t` or `--templates`

  > Indicate that the command is responsible for updating to the latest version of the template defined by the 
  > application.  Running this command without specifying a template to install will only install and update the base
  > template.  If the base template version has already been installed, this command will do nothing.
  
- `-T` or `--template-definition`

  > Define the template that should be installed into the log directory.  This can be a URL that points to a zip file,
  > a local zip file, or a local directory containing a template definition.
  
## Example Execution

To update the log files that are defined:

```bash
autology update -f
```

To update the log files and the base template definition:

```bash
autology update -f -t
```

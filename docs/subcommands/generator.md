# Generator Subcomand

This command walks through the contents of the logs directory and publishes the contents of each file to an output 
directory.   

## Configuration

The configuration of this tool is done through the configuration of the plugins.  They are documented separately.  

## Extending

This command's functionality is extended by adding additional reports to the framework.  Each of the files that is 
processed will be published to the `autology.topics.Processing.PROCESS_FILE` topic.  Additional topics are provided 
for beginning the processing, ending the processing and then for each day when it starts and finishes.

## Example Execution

```bash
autology generate
```

# Reports

Reports are functionality components that are used by the `generate` command.  They gather data by subscribing to a 
collection of events and then use that to publish output using the publisher.  When finished they can register a report
entry point with the `index` report that will add links to the main page of the output log.

## Registration

Reports are registered with the application through entry points.  Reports use the `autology_reports` entry point to 
register an initialization method.  This method should only be used to subscribe to the `autology.topics.Application` 
events that are published and to define the default configuration values for the report.  The configuration file isn't
loaded until all of the plugins have had their content registered.

The `topics.Application.INITIALIZE` topic is published before the sub-command starts executing.

```python
from autology.configuration import add_default_configuration, get_configuration
from autology import topics


def report_initialization():
  topics.Application.INITIALIZE.subscribe(_process_configuration)
  
  add_default_configuration('my_key', {
    "some_key": "some_value",
    "other_key": False
  })
  
def _process_configuration():
  configuration = get_configuration()
  
  # Do something with the configuration details
  print('my_key.some_key value: {}'.format(configuration.my_key.some_key))
```

## Generation Workflow

The generator will publish several events that can be subscribed to.  These are documented in the 
`autology.topics.Processing` object to include the parameters that are provided.  Examples of reports are defined in
the [project](../../autology/reports/project/project.py) and [timeline](../../autology/reports/timeline/timeline.py) 
report modules.

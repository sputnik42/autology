# Sub-commands

Sub-commands provide a means of iterating over the data and providing some kind of functionality.  For example, the 
`generator` command will iterate over all of the files that are stored in the logs directory and translate that data 
into a static HTML output containing dashboard information.

## Registration

Sub-commands are registered into the framework using the python entry point `autology_commands`.  The method that is 
provided is responsible for building up the `argparse` sub processor with the relevant flags.  One of the values
that must be added is the default called `func`.  This is the method that will be called later with the results of 
processing the arguments.

```python
def register_command(subparser):
    """Register the subcommand with any additional arguments."""
    parser = subparser.add_parser('some_command', help='Command help')
    parser.set_defaults(func=_main)
    
    parser.add_argument('--foo', action='store_true', default=False)
    
    
def _main(args):
    """Method that will be executed once arguments have been parsed."""
    print('args.foo: {}'.format(args.foo))
```
